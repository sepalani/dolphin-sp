This is the subset of Qt on which dolphin relies for development and
distribution tasks. The folder structure is maintained in order to facilitate
easier diffing against other versions of Qt.

Note that this subset only supports building and deploying dolphin. If you want
the full Qt development toolset, you will need to install them separately.
